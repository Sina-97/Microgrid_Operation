# Microgrid_Operation
This microgrid operation project aims to minimize cost and distribute power to supply all demands. 
The microgrid has different DG power sources and contains electrical and thermal demands. Our goal is to supply all demands to first minimize the cost and emission
and also buy/sell power from/to the main grid.

This problem consists of two parts:
1-Microgrid operation which is an optimization problem 2-A unit commitment(UC) problem that decides which units should be working and supplying power. 

For running the code you need to open Micro_grid.m file.
